# HGPatcher

## Description

---

**HGPatcher** isn't a standalone tool : It's actually 2 scripts you can run in [UMT](undertalemodtool.md).

**HGExport.csx** finds the differences between a vanilla data.win and a modified one, and extracts only the modified code.  
In practice however, I found it struggled to do so, and often produced random files, sometimes missing some of the modifications I made.

**HGPatcher.csx** attempts to patch the changes from a data.win onto another data.win.  
The main issue with this is that when patching mods which add content, you will have issues with asset IDs.

You can check out the guide `Cuistre#5656` made about HGPatcher [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDdEWc_3JZ7s08oWJ5h2j0tSgOSdeUq76_yMzvQyC2s/edit#heading=h.6e401rtx4zo).
