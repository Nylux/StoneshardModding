# UndertaleModTool

## Description

---

**UndertaleModTool**, often abreviated **UMT**, is the main tool you will be using to create mods.

As the name implies it was initially made for Undertale, but works well with Stoneshard since both of
them were made with the same game engine, **Gamemaker Studio**.

We use UndertaleModTool to open and edit the **data.win** file, which contains all of the game's data.

## Download

---

You can find the latest version of UMT over on Github.

It's recommended to grab the latest ==***Bleeding Edge***== release for your operating system, as development
is fairly active and developers are fixing issues often.

## Usage

---

Locate your **data.win** file, which should be in your game installation directory.  
By default :

- Steam : `C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Stoneshard`
- GOG : `C:\Games\Stoneshard`

Once found, simply double click on it to open it with UndertaleModTool.
